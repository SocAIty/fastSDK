# Development instructions
 
## 1. Think Before Coding
 
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**
 
Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them. Don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- Use thinking methods like Elon Musk's first principle reasoning or design-thinking for complex tasks.
 
## 2. Simplicity First
 
**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Don't repeat yourself.
 
Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.
 
## 3. Surgical Changes
 
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**
 
When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
 
When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
 
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
 
## 4. Code quality and style
- Write high-quality, developer-friendly and clean-code, use design-patterns (Refactoring Guru) where helpful. 
- Include docstrings and comments to explain the why of a non-obvious method or code. No decorative comments.
- Write memory and compute efficient code.
- Write pythonic code and use builtins when it simplifies (generators, list-comprehensions, functools).
- Reduce complexity and boilerplate. Remove unused code.
- State unclear variable names and rename for better readability and clearity.
- Avoid local imports
- Do not write "deprecated" or backward compability code.
- Update the README.md if there's user related important changes. Update TECHNICAL_README.md for architectural, or project maintainer important changes. Keep the .md update brief use technical correct terms.
- Write ruff formatted code with ignores E203, W503, W501, W293, W291 and lineLenght 120.
- Avoid using direct cmd python calls and pip installs.
- When executing python code, always use the local venv of the corresponding project.
- Dev tools are make, ruff, mypy, pytest.
- Always ask before writing a test file.

## 5. Reason and thinking style
Do thinking and reasoning like a smart caveman.
- Cut all filler, keep technical substance.
- Drop articles (a, an, the), filler (just, really, basically, actually).
- Drop pleasantries (sure, certainly, happy to).
- No hedging. Fragments fine. Short synonyms.
- Technical terms stay exact. Code blocks unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step]
 
## 6. Public facing texts: Readmes, prints, logs.
- Write as technically brilliant European expert who gives you straight answers, backs claims with data, and genuinely wants you to succeed.
- Ttone spectrum Formality 35% (lean casual) · Humor 25% (dry, never flippant) · Complexity 40% (lean technical) · Confidence 80% (very confident). 
- Direct without being cold. Say what you mean, no corporate padding. Warm without being informal. Complete sentences, measured enthusiasm. Committed, not hedging. 
- Committed, not hedging. "This works", not "this might work".
- "We" for the platform, "you" for the reader. Reserve "I" for rare authored guides only.
- Developer-first, technical correct terms.
- No em-dashes. The character `—` (U+2014) must not appear in ANYWHERE. Use a period, comma, parentheses, or colon.
- No marketing adverbs like seamlessly, effortlessly, robust, powerful, cutting-edge, automatically, intelligently, revolutionary, game-changing, world-class, best-in-class. E.g. three steps, ~X minutes" beats "easy onboarding".
- No bullet-everything. Bullets only for true enumerations (statuses, regions, tiers).
- Subtle transmit socaity's vision and use emotional-intelligence and marketing techniques for end-user intent based messages.
- Use google docstring format.
- The four brand hues (each tied to an ICP) with Tonal scales (50/300/500/700/900). Apply where makes sense.
| Name                         | Hex         | Meaning / ICP                                                             |
